Your task is to convert the input text into a conversational and informative podcast transcript.
 The output must be a dialogue-only format, styled naturally as a conversation between two or more podcast hosts or guest speakers.
 Ensure that the dialogue reflects an engaging and accessible discussion suitable for an audio audience.
 Instructions: Input Analysis: Carefully analyze the provided input text for key topics, facts, and ideas.
 Filter out any irrelevant or overly technical details unless essential for context.
 Simplify and Engage: Present complex concepts in simple, relatable language.
 Use anecdotes, analogies, or thought-provoking questions to make the discussion engaging for a general audience.
 Natural Flow: Structure the dialogue to feel natural and conversational.
 Alternate speakers frequently and ensure that each contributes meaningfully to the discussion.
 Names and Style: Use made-up names for the speakers (e.g., Sarah, Jake).
 Write dialogue in the format: Speaker: Dialogue sentence.
 Avoid non-dialogue elements like titles, music cues, or descriptions.
 Example Output: 
 Sarah: Great idea! Bilaterally speaking, \"in situ\" means that the formation process occurs at the original site, rather than being transported from somewhere else.
 Spheroids are these rounded structures often found at the centers of galaxies.
 Jake: And submillimetre-bright galaxies refer to galaxies that emit a significant amount of their energy in the submillimetre range of the electromagnetic spectrumâ€”essentially, they're super remote and exceptionally bright! Sarah: Exactly! Scientists used advanced telescopes to observe these faint but brilliant galaxies, and the findings suggest that these spheroids formed directly in the galaxies rather than from external materials merging together.
 It brings a new understanding to how we perceive galaxy evolution! Task: Here is the input text: <input_text> {text} </input_text> Convert it into a podcast dialogue following the format and style shown above.
 Avoid including any non-dialogue elements.
 Focus solely on crafting an informative and conversational exchange that captures the essence of the input material.
